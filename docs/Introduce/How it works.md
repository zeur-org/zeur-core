# Architecture
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832dc53a-a694-4723-8aac-ed25d433ed15)

- **Pool**: entry contract for users (supply, withdraw, borrow, repay, liquidate)
- **Vaults**: manage user deposited asset through Pool, interact with routers to stake asset in LST protocol. Each vault is isolated and can have different staking routers.
- **StakingRouter**: plug-and-play contract that have the same interface, but different logics for each LST protocol (Lido, Etherfi, RocketPool, StakeLink or lending market like Morpho on Ethereum, LST like Benqi on Avalanche)
- **Tokenization**: ColEURC/DebtEUR represent the user's supply/debt of EUR stablecoins, ColToken represents the user's collateral
- **ChainlinkOracleManager**: to get price of asset through Chainlink price feeds
- **ProtocolVaultManager**: dedicated contract with harvest/distribute yield and rebalance portfolio logics
- **ProtocolSettingManager**: dedicated contract with admin-level configurations for the pool
- **ProtocolAccessManager**: contract with admin-level access management for protocol
- **Chainlink Automation**: time-based keeper that execute distribute yield
- **ElizaOS**: offchain "brain" to monitor position, create strategy, execute rebalance

# **Component Breakdown**

## **Borrower / Lender Interface**

- **Borrower** can `deposit`, `borrow`, `repay`, `spotRepay`, and `autoRepay`.
- **Lender** deposits EUR stablecoins (`colEURC`) to supply liquidity.

## **LendingPool**

- Core contract that handles lending and borrowing.
- **PoolConfigurator** provides admin-level configurations for the pool.

## **Collateral Vaults**

- Separate vaults for different collateral assets:

  - `stETHVault`: For staked ETH from Lido and similar sources.
  - `ETHVault`: For native ETH.
  - `LINKVault`: For Chainlink tokens.

- All vaults mint **colTokens** (e.g., colstETH, colETH, colLINK).
- Collateral tokens are **non-rebase ERC20** for stable asset tracking.

## **VaultManager**

- Handles **DeFi registry + direct rebalancing**.
- Interfaces with vaults to auto-distribute and auto-compound yields.
- Interacts with external protocols:

  - **Lido, RocketPool, Etherfi**: For ETH staking.
  - **Morpho / Aave**: For lending strategies.
  - **LINK staking**: For Chainlink-based yield.

## **ElizaOS**

> The strategic engine of the Zeur protocol

- Key features:
  1. **Position Management**: Defines target allocations, tracks vault balances and withdrawal queues.
  2. **Data Fetching**: Gathers APRs, gas prices, and optionally cross-chain liquidity data.
  3. **Yield / Market Analytics**: Tracks performance, risk, and applies auto-compounding.
  4. **Optimization Engine**: Simulates scenarios, calculates best allocations, and sets thresholds.
  5. **Execution / Automation**: Executes rebalance transactions based on strategy.
  6. **Monitoring / Logging**: Logs activity and status.

## **Chainlink Integration**

- **Price Feeds**: Real-time prices for assets like ETH, LINK, stETH.
- **Automation**: Automatically triggers conditions such as auto-repay or liquidation.
- **Staking**: Integrated with LINKVault for staking functionality.

## **Euro Stablecoin Structure**

- `colEURC`: ERC4626-based collateralized EUR stablecoins.
- `debEURC`: Debt tokens representing borrowed amounts.
- Total assets:

  ```
  totalAssets = balanceOf(colEURC) + debEURC.totalSupply
  ```

# **DEX Integration (Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, etc.)**

- Enables:
  - **Instant withdrawal** using DEX (check for rate/slippage).
  - **Large withdrawals** and LINK withdrawals to queue.
  - **spotRepay / autoRepay** for debt management.
  - **Simple liquidation** system.

# **Expansion Ideas (from Notes section)**

- **VaultManager for EUR stablecoins**
  â†’ Proposed to optimize unused EUR in protocols like Morpho/Aave. Needs careful implementation to balance yield and liquidity.
