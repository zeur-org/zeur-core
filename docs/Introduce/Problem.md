# The Problem
Many crypto holders, particularly in Europe, view their assets as long-term investments. In some countries, for example Germany and Portugal, crypto asset gains are tax-free after holding for more than one year. They don't want to sell, which would trigger a taxable event and cause them to miss out on potential future appreciation. However, they often need cash for major life purchases like a down payment on a house, a car, or other significant expenses.

Their current options are very limited for real world spending:
1. **Borrow from DeFi (Aave/Compound)**: Traditional DeFi lending has variable, often high-interest rates that can exceed standard consumer loans (which are ~4-7% in Europe). This makes borrowing for real-world expenses unpredictable and potentially expensive.
2. **Borrow from TradFi (Consumer/Mortgage Loan)**: While rates can be lower (~3-5%), the process is slow, requires extensive paperwork, and doesn't recognize crypto as collateral.
3. **Use other "Zero-Interest" Protocols**: Services like Alchemix or Liquity are innovative but force borrowers to take out loans in a new, protocol-specific stablecoin (like alUSD or LUSD). These stablecoins lack the liquidity, trust, and direct off-ramps to be easily converted into Euros and used for real-life purchases.

Since we personnaly experienced this problem, we decided to build a protocol that would solve it.
